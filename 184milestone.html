<h2 align="middle">What We've Accomplished</h2>
<div class="padded">
    <p>
        For this project milestone, our group has accomplished the initial working model of our smoke simulation. This
        means that we have developed a fully interactive webpage primarily powered by Javascript, GLSL, and the three.js
        framework. This interactive webpage functions as a demo for users to see how smoke interacts within a contained
        system under their control as they introduce new smoke. Any user input will generate the corresponding smoke
        within the simulated system. As it stands, the system is balanced more towards being computationally manageable
        versus being an ideally realistic simulation. However, that allows for it to run fluidly and without any
        unexpected slowdowns. While multiple GUI features could still be added, we have implemented some controls that
        allow for basic smoke customization. These controls include the radius of the smoke circle generated from the
        cursor interaction, and red, green, and blue pixel controls to modify the color of the generated smoke to match
        the desired effect. These two customizations allow for a wide array of possible results, with significantly
        more possible given later customization additions.
    </p>

<h2 align="middle">Future Directions</h2>
<div class="padded">
    <p>
        In the future, we plan to add more controls to allow for the user to customize many features including, but not
        limited to, the temperature, pressure, and vorticity of the smoke within their smoke simulation. As well as
        this, we hope to successfully implement the ability to add objects in the scene to interact with the smoke
        during the simulation. These could be a fan that blows smoke in a given direction, or a simple object such as a
        block that would collide with the smoke and limit its movement at certain points. Other shapes of objects could
        also be inserted to observe their differing effects within the system. Sources of constant smoke could similarly
        be inserted within the scene to add to the overall smoke being generated.

<h2 align="middle">Reflection on our Progress</h2>
<div class="padded">
    <p>
        When compared to our original plan, we are happy with our current progress at this milestone and donâ€™t feel the
        need to reflect any planned changes. The schedule created at the beginning of the project has so far proved
        accurate, and as such we expect it to similarly prove an accurate estimation in how long it will take us to
        reach our next goals.
