		Catan is an extremely popular board game revolving around gathering as many points as fast as possible by utilizing resources to expand/enhance your settlements.

			The general gist of every strategy in catan is comboing certain resources so that you can build specific buildings quicker. There are two main combos in catan:  
			<br><br>
			<b> <font color = "brown">Log </font> + <font color = "#ff3030"> Brick </font> Combo: </b> By pairing these two, you can build roads extremely quickly allowing you to maximize your expansion speed. 
			<br>
			<font color = "#C0C0C0"> Win Condition: </font> Longest road + a lot of settlements + 1-2 cities 
			<br>
			<font color = "#A9A9A9"> Early game: </font> Your first move should 99% of the time be to build 1-2 roads and a settlement in the direction of future expansion or onto a tile with high resource frequency. You should not be too worried about transforming your settlements into cities but instead be focused on claiming as much territory as possible. On top of that, you should be expanding toward a useful port (hopefully log/brick 2:1) to ease your transition into late game and trying to figure out how to get your hands on wheat/ore.
			<br>
			<font color = "#808080"> Late Game: </font> At this point, you should have about 6-8 points (longest road + 4/5 settlements + 0/1 city). Here, you want to start focusing on building cities in order to free up settlements and attain the last couple of points. Avoid dev cards because they are inconsistent and unrewarding unless purchased in bulk but can be still can be utilized as a last ditch effort or with extraneous resources

			<br><br>
			<font color = "#DAA520"> Wheat </font> + <font color = "grey"> Ore </font> Combo: This combination revolves less around expansion and more around turning settlements into cities in order to snowball early-game resource acculumation. 
			<br>
			<font color = "#C0C0C0"> Win Condition: </font> 3/4 cities + some mix of longest road, largest army, settlements, and/or dev point cards
			<br>
			<font color = "#A9A9A9"> Early game: </font> Depending on which resources fall into your hands early on in the game, there are two paths you can take with this strategy. The first is to focus on attaining at minimum at least 1 other settlement. The primary purpose of this settlement is simply to become upgraded into a city later on in the game for the point value. The second path to take is upgrading one of your two inital settlements into cities within the first two turns of the game allowing you to exponentially increase resource production on often high frequency tiles. The problem with this strategy is though you drastically increase resource acculumation, you lose out on early expansion posibilities and thus might be corned in a way such that you won't be able to expand and create other cities. Thus, if you want to pursue this path, you must make sure that there are places you can settle later on in the game even if they are sub-optimal resource wise.
			<br>
			<font color = "#808080"> Late Game: </font> Here, you should have 2-3 cities and 1-2 settlements and be on the verge of getting either longest road or largest army. At this point, the game basically plays itself as your resource acculumation goes off the charts. You should focus on maintaining less than 7 cards in case of the robber and creating settlements/cities however possible while purchasing dev cards with extra resources.
			<br><br>
			In general, you don't want to go for a mix of these two strategies i.e (brick 6, ore 8, log 12, sheep 5, wheat 10) because you'll be too reliant on trading early game and you'll end up not being able to expand quick enough. The exception to this rule is if you have easy access to a 2:1 port early game

			<a name="placements"><font color="#9370DB"><b> Placements </b></font> </a><br>
			Your first two settlements that you place down set the pace and are arguably the most important moves you make in the entire game. These two settlemets determine which strategy you will be going for, what direction you'll expand in, and your early game resources. The main factors that you need to consider when determining early game placement are:
			<br><br>
			<b>Strategy:</b> which of log/brick or wheat/ore will give you the largest chance at winning. If you are placing first or second, you often want to go for the wheat/ore strategy because your settlements will be dispersed across the map as you have to wait for a lot of additional settlements before you can place your second settlement. This makes the log/brick strategy harder to go for because you might not be able to connect your settlements and you have less territory to expand into. Otherwise, its just based on personal judgement.
			<br><br>
			<b>Resource Diversity:</b> no matter which strategy you pick, you want to have access to more than 2-3 resources as it puts you in a more flexible position to trade. On top of that, even if you have access to a port, you'll end up swapping in resources (2:1, 3:1, 4:1), which is relatively unproductive. In general, you want to have access to at least 4 resources (the least important resource by far being sheep) with the resources your strategy relates to at a higher frequency.
			<br><br>
			<b>Expansion:</b> you want to place your settlements in such a way that you are not bottlenecked and will still be able to expand outwards. This is important because if you can't expand and build settlements you not only can't increase your rate of resource growth but also lose access to potential points from cities/settlements. In general, you want to make sure that you have access to at least 1-2 different potential settlement spots that are only two roads away. If settlements are further than that, you might lose them to other people who want to expand in the same direction.
			<br><br>
			<b>Ports:</b> ports are the ultimate late game resource. When you are ahead, people are less likely to trade with you and hence you need to become more self-reliant. On top of that, later on in the game, you will have access to so many resources that you often can sacrifice the individual value of a resource in order to attain other resources. Finally, ports allow you to convert early game resources that end up useless later in the game such as brick and log into productive resources. In general, you should at the minimum get a 3:1 port though you should aim for a 2:1 port of a resource that you are able to accumulate a lot of. It's not a bad strategy to settle on a 2:1 port with one of your first two initial settlements even though you may not have access to as many resources if you do that.
			<br><br>
			<b>Messing up opponent placement: </b>if your opponent has a 6 ore, you probably want to make sure you don't let your opponent get the 8 wheat across the map. If your opponent is going for the log + brick strategy, you may want to place a settlement in between their two settlements to make it more difficult for them to connect the two. if your opponent has sheep 6, 8, you probably want to block off the way to the sheep 2:1 port. etc.

			<a name="trading"><font color="#AAAAFF"><b> Trading </b></font></a><br>
			The key to becoming successful in catan is to take favorable trades whenever possible. This can be done by following these easy guidelines:
			<br><br>
			1. Whenever possible, avoid trading when it isn't your turn to build. If you don't trade on your turn, your opponent gets instantly rewarded whilst you have to wait til your turn to reap the benefits of the trade.
			<br><br>
			2. Don't trade for the long term, make sure that if you are trading, you can immedietely use the resource you traded for. Your gameplan will be constantly evolving and since trading is mutually beneficial, you may put your opponent in place where he/she can use the resource in such a way that renders the resource that you attained to be useless. For example, you two are fighting over a settlement spot and they block you off with roads making it impossible to build a settlement there hence rending the resources you traded for irrelevent and giving your opponent the edge.
			<br><br>
			3. Use your judgement, don't put yourself in a losing position -- always consider the fact that trades are mutually beneficial. Don't trade with someone if they're in a place to utilize that trade against you.

			<a name="dev cards"><font color="#499DF5"><b> Dev Cards </b></font></a><br>
			14 knights (56%), <br> 5 victory point (20%), <br> 2 monopoly (8%), <br> 2 road building (8%), <br> 2 year of plenty (8%)
			<br><br>
			In general dev cards are a value vacuum; they should only be bought late in the game when you need those last couple victory points or as a hail mary if you're extremely behind. In general, unless you're heavy on at least two of wheat, ore, or sheep, you should avoid dev cards and can easily win without. That being said, if you aren't settled on a lot of grounds, building a large army of dev cards is actually beneficially becuase it will make sure the robber can never stop you in addition to providing the largest army dev card.

			<a name="the robber"><font color="#75A1D0"><b> The Robber </b></font></a> <br>
			The robber has 2 purposes: <br>
			1. Limit expansion/resource production <br>
			2. Get a one of of a resource you need 
			<br><br>
			Take both into consideration.

			1. Catan is just a game of min maxing. Every decision you make has its trade-offs and benefits; it's important to understand the decisions that you push you in the right direction.
			<br>
			2. Take into consideration what start will allow you to snowball the fastest because that will let you control the game
			<br>
			3. Trust your gut
			<br>
			4. Reading guides isn't that beneficial to get better
